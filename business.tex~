\section{Executive summary}

SubZero Ice is an innovative business aimed at providing ice-cream in a more personal, novel and exciting way. Our patented process allows us to use liquid-nitrogen as a freezing agent, providing customers with a fantastic visual display as they await their ice-cream. What sets us apart from our competition is that our ice-cream is not pre-prepared, but is made directly in front of our customers using the ingredients they choose. 
Interest in our product has already been shown by several companies including London Science Museum, Alton Towers, Odeon Cinemas and London Royal Parks. We have provided our product at events at London Design Museum, National Space Centre and the Tate Modern.

\section{Vision statement}

Our goal is not only to provide great tasting ice-cream but also to provide our customers with an unique and memorable experience. We hope that our appealing laboratory-themed stalls will soon be seen in many tourist locations and at large events throughout the UK.
We also aim to streamline our equipment which will allow our product to be introduced to establishments in the hospitality sector such as bars and nightclubs.

Consumer and regulatory pressure
 - Always pressure from consumers for new exciting products.

 - Pressure to create a product which will capture the imaginations of
consumers more than competing products.

ethics.
fairtrade - look at poverty + with partners
health - healthier than normal ice cream due to fresh ingredients and less use of preservatives
eco(water recycling, using up all ingredients) - recycle waste. recycle all water. solar energy. supply of ingredients and LN2.

type = corporation


\section{Market Analysis}
  \subsection{Market Drivers}

 - Liquid nitrogen products are expanding as a market (eg: cocktails/
other ice cream firms) therefore demand for them increasing

 - Events and hospitality companies are constantly looking to put
on more of a show to gain the advantage over competitors – this
should generate sales as we get more widespread.

 - We are at the forefront of developing market and want to grow this
market through the hospitality industry.

 - We believe that we provide a better, more scalable product than
competitors and are therefore in prime position to take the majority
of the market share.

 - Historically successful ice-cream products are primarily those
which have the most market appeal and capture the consumers
imagination. With our product we hope to generate lots of consumer
interest through our unique approach to ice-cream. However,
in order to retain our customers our ice-cream must also taste
better than our competitors. We believe our fresh ingredients and
luxuriously smooth ice-cream will ensure that this is the case.

  \subsection{Current Equity Structure}

  \subsection{Management team}

Jon Watson has many years experience working with and managing small
businesses. He prides himself on the fact that every small business which he
has managed has gone on to be highly successful. His attention to detail and
vast experience working with start-ups make him an invaluable leader and we
feel privileged that he has chosen to work with us. He is considered an expert in
discovering what makes a small businesses tick and in finding ways to develop
a unique culture within a business.


\section{Competition}
  Small number of direct competitors

  Certainly none with the success and interest that we have already
generated


  \subsection{Competitive Advantage}

We believe our product has several clear competitive advantages over
other ice-cream brands currently on the market. Below we list some of these advantages.

 - Our ice-cream is velvety smooth, creamy and freshly made. Due to
the unique freezing process our ice-cream is guaranteed to be free of
large ice crystals giving a delicious texture like no other ice-cream on the
market.

 - Our process instantly freezes the freshest of ingredients, providing
an unsurpassed flavour. Since we make the ice-creams freshly for
our customers it means there is also much more scope for different
flavourings. Customers can choose any of our fresh ingredients they like and combine them in any way they choose.

 - Another clear competitive advantage of using liquid nitrogen is that
it provides a unique and fascinating spectacle that normal ice cream
stalls simply cannot provide. We believe that creating an impressive
visual experience for our customers and putting on a show is almost
as important as the ice-cream itself. Through this unique blend
of entertainment and delicious ice-cream we hope to capture the
imaginations of our customers.

 - We also have the advantage of novelty. Many consumers will never
have tried or even heard of liquid nitrogen ice-cream before and so
we hope that one-off novelty purchases will help us to be even more
successful, especially during the first few years of business.

 - Since the customer has complete control over the ingredients which are used in their ice-cream, apart from the base ingredients, our ice-creams have the potential to be more healthy than our competitors. This can only help, given the current trend towards healthy, low-fat foods.

\section{Intellectual Property Assets}

  \subsection{Patents}
    Patented process

In terms of technology we currently use standard liquid nitrogen storage tanks at our stalls. Our innovation is not in the technology we use but in how we use it. All of our equipment is carefully designed to fit in with our stores' laboratory theme. We also use smoke machines and coloured smoke to make our stalls look more visually appealing.

We hope to raise enough capital to be able to purchase more compact storage units, in order to branch out our business into cafe's or bars.

installations

 - Odeon, Alton Towers, Thorpe Park?

   LTV = (Tn + ATV + LT) - (CoA + CoR) 

  \subsection{Current key customers}

  Currently provided product as one off temporary stall for ….

  They have expressed interest in returning to us

  \subsection{Marketing, PR and Communications}
  At the moment our main form of marketing are the stalls themselves.
Given the exciting way we present our product the stalls often generate
a lot interest, which large groups of people watching our ice-cream
being made simply out of interest before they make a purchase.

In the future as we move into more permanent fixtures we hope to use
more traditional marketing methods.???

We are currently developing a website which we think will play a vital
role in generating more consumer interest. Through this website we will
give our customers the opportunity to contact us and leave feedback on
their experience with our product.

We also wish to focus strongly on interacting with social media sites
such as Facebook and Twitter as we believe this will allow us to quickly
generate interest, receive comments and interact directly with our
customers. Additionally this will allow us to collect information about
our customers, for example the average age of our customers. It is with
such information that we hope to be able to tailor our future marketing.

In order to generate interest online we will hold regular competitions
and prize draws, in which the winners will receive vouchers to spend on
our ice-cream. We also plan to video some of our stalls in action and
post on YouTube.???

  \subsection{Staff Recuritment}


 - Staff to work at stalls – require training + health and safety
requirements

 - Marketing and PR staff

 - Product Designers

 - Transport team – responsible for transporting stalls and equipment to events and setting them up, following high safety standards

 - Finance team

 - Legal team

Place to store all equipment when not in use
