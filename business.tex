\section{Executive summary}

SubZero Ice is an innovative business aimed at providing ice-cream in a more personal, novel and exciting way. Our patented process allows us to use liquid-nitrogen as a freezing agent, providing customers with a fantastic visual display as they await their ice-cream. What sets us apart from our competition is that our ice-cream is not pre-prepared, but is made directly in front of our customers using the ingredients they choose. 
Interest in our product has already been shown by several companies including London Science Museum, Alton Towers, Odeon Cinemas and London Royal Parks. We have provided our product at events at London Design Museum, National Space Centre and the Tate Modern.

\section{Vision statement}

Our goal is not only to provide great tasting ice-cream but also to provide our customers with an unique and memorable experience. We hope that our appealing laboratory-themed stalls will soon be seen in many tourist locations and at large events throughout the UK.
We also aim to streamline our equipment which will allow our product to be introduced to establishments in the hospitality sector such as bars and nightclubs.
