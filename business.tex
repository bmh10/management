\section{Executive summary}

SubZero Ice is an innovative business aimed at providing ice-cream in a more personal, novel and exciting way. Our patented process allows us to use liquid-nitrogen as a freezing agent, providing customers with delicious, velvety smooth ice-cream along with a fantastic visual display as they watch their chosen ice-cream being prepared. What sets us apart from the competition is our focus on providing a unique customer experience as well as producing the highest quality ice-cream. In addition our instantly recognisable laboratory-themed stalls and enthusiastic ice-cream makers ensure that no one can pass us by unnoticed. We also pride ourselves on our use of fresh, organic ingredients in all of our products. \\

At the current time our main business focus is on acquiring a positive reputation at prestigious public events throughout the UK. During this period of growth and learning our business has recieved a remarkable amount of interest from some of the major event organisers in the UK as well as some press coverage. We have recieved hundreds of invitations to operate our stalls at public events, however given the relative age of our business coupled with our rapid success, we currently do not have to capital required in order to meet the demands of our expanding customer base. Having seen firsthand how customers react to our product we believe that it is time to take our relatively small business to the next level, hopefully expanding the area within which we operate to the whole of the UK. \\

Some of the companies that have already shown an interest in our business include the London Science Museum, Alton Towers, Odeon Cinemas, London Royal Parks and the organisers of music and arts festivals such as Glastonbury, Reading and Latitude. We have provided ice-cream and entertainment with much success at a large variety of events and demonstrations across England.


\section{Vision statement}

Our main goal is and always will be not only to provide great tasting ice-cream for our customers but also to provide them with an memorable experience. We strongly believe that their is a direct relationship between the amount of fun our staff are having and the number of customers we can attract. We also place the highest priority on producing quality ice-cream as we realise that even if the novelty of our product begins to fade over time, we will still be making the tastiest ice-cream on the market. \\

SubZero Ice is a worker cooperative meaning that all of our staff can have a say on any decisions which need to be made. This structure has helped us to create a workforce who intrinsically care about the business and its future. We place great importance on being both ethical and economical within all spheres of business. All our stalls use solar panals to generate energy and our staff all follow a strict recycling policy which helps us to reduce costs and as well as doing our bit for the environment. The majority of our fresh ingredients are fairtrade and organic as we believe that in order to make the best ice-cream we need to use the best ingredients. We also provide comprehensive training for all our staff to ensure that they can safely handle liquid nitrogen. \\

Assuming that we manage to raise enough capital to expand our business activites over the next few years, we plan to focus our attention on scaling up our resources to match our ever increasing customer demand. At the same time we hope to branch out in other directions by introducing new products and also streamlining our specialised equipment which will allow our products to be introduced to establishments in the hospitality sector such as at bars and cafes.

\section{Market Analysis}
  
  Before delving into our business structure and our ideas for the future we though it would be wise to give a general overview of the current state of the ice-cream and conveneice foods markets so that the reader can gain a deeper insight into the current climate we are working in.

  \subsection{Market Drivers}

   We first take a look at current trends within the markets we are involved with and relate each observation to our own business. We hope that by predicting the direction the market will take we will be able to meet and exceed our customer's expectations.

 - The use of liquid nitrogen in consumer food products is increasing as more businesses turn to \"molecular gastronomy\" (the science of investigating and explaining how physical and chemical transformations can be made during cooking) in order to improve the taste and visual appeal of thier products. For example, some modern chefs use liquid nitrogen in the kitchen to change the consitancy of food. The cocktail industry have already taken note of this trend and has started to introduce products which use liquid nitrogen, mainly for its visual effect. We predict that in the future more companies will turn to molecular gastronomy in order to compete with the competition. Since we have patented our unique ice-cream making process, which makes use of liquid nitrogen, we feel that we are in a strong position to take the majority market share for our niche in the market. 


 - Events and hospitality companies are constantly looking to put on more of a show to gain the advantage over competitors – this should generate sales as we get more widespread.
 %here%


 - Historically successful ice-cream products are primarily those
which have the most market appeal and capture the consumers
imagination. With our product we hope to generate lots of consumer
interest through our unique approach to ice-cream. However,
in order to retain our customers our ice-cream must also taste
better than our competitors. We believe our fresh ingredients and
luxuriously smooth ice-cream will ensure that this is the case.


  \subsection{Market Segments}

  \subsection{Management team}

Jon Watson has many years experience working with and managing small
businesses. He prides himself on the fact that every small business which he has managed has gone on to be highly successful. His attention to detail and vast experience working with start-ups make him an invaluable leader and we feel privileged that he has chosen to work with us. He is considered an expert in discovering what makes a small businesses tick and in finding ways to develop a unique culture within a business.


\section{Competition}
  Small number of direct competitors

  Certainly none with the success and interest that we have already generated

  In terms of mainstream ice-cream companies...


  \subsection{Competitive Advantage}

We believe our product has several clear competitive advantages over
other ice-cream brands currently on the market. Below we list some of these advantages.

 - Our ice-cream is velvety smooth, creamy and freshly made. Due to
the unique freezing process our ice-cream is guaranteed to be free of
large ice crystals giving a delicious texture like no other ice-cream on the
market.

 - Our process instantly freezes the freshest of ingredients, providing
an unsurpassed flavour. Since we make the ice-creams freshly for
our customers it means there is also much more scope for different
flavourings. Customers can choose any of our fresh ingredients they like and combine them in any way they choose.

 - Another clear competitive advantage of using liquid nitrogen is that
it provides a unique and fascinating spectacle that normal ice cream
stalls simply cannot provide. We believe that creating an impressive
visual experience for our customers and putting on a show is almost
as important as the ice-cream itself. Through this unique blend
of entertainment and delicious ice-cream we hope to capture the
imaginations of our customers.

 - We also have the advantage of novelty. Many consumers will never
have tried or even heard of liquid nitrogen ice-cream before and so
we hope that one-off novelty purchases will help us to be even more
successful, especially during the first few years of business.

 - Since the customer has complete control over the ingredients which are used in their ice-cream, apart from the base ingredients, our ice-creams have the potential to be more healthy than our competitors. This can only help, given the current trend towards healthy, low-fat foods.

\section{Intellectual Property Assets}

  \subsection{Patents}
    Patented process

In terms of technology we currently use standard liquid nitrogen storage tanks at our stalls. Our innovation is not in the technology we use but in how we use it. All of our equipment is carefully designed to fit in with our stores' laboratory theme. We also use smoke machines and coloured smoke to make our stalls look more visually appealing.

We hope to raise enough capital to be able to purchase more compact storage units, in order to branch out our business into cafe's or bars.

  \subsection{Target customers}
Tourists of all ages. Especially families with children and young adults
who are more likely to be at festivals.

 - Odeon, Alton Towers, Thorpe Park?

   LTV = (Tn + ATV + LT) - (CoA + CoR) 

  \subsection{Current key customers}

  Currently provided product as one off temporary stall for ….

  They have expressed interest in returning to us

  \subsection{Marketing, PR and Communications}
  At the moment our main form of marketing are the stalls themselves.
Given the exciting way we present our product the stalls often generate
a lot interest, which large groups of people watching our ice-cream
being made simply out of interest before they make a purchase.

In the future as we move into more permanent fixtures we hope to use
more traditional marketing methods.???

We are currently developing a website which we think will play a vital
role in generating more consumer interest. Through this website we will
give our customers the opportunity to contact us and leave feedback on
their experience with our product.

We also wish to focus strongly on interacting with social media sites
such as Facebook and Twitter as we believe this will allow us to quickly
generate interest, receive comments and interact directly with our
customers. Additionally this will allow us to collect information about
our customers, for example the average age of our customers. It is with
such information that we hope to be able to tailor our future marketing.

In order to generate interest online we will hold regular competitions
and prize draws, in which the winners will receive vouchers to spend on
our ice-cream. We also plan to video some of our stalls in action and
post on YouTube.???

  \subsection{Staff Recuritment}

  Currently all of our staff operate from our headquarters in central London. As our customer base expands we will need to recruit the following staff:

 \bold{Ice-cream makers} – ice-cream makers are the life and soul of SubZero Ice. In order to qualify for the role candidates will have to show genuine enthusiasm and commitment to the company as well as being able to work well under pressure infront of crowds. Candidates must also be very flexible as they will have to travel to different locations each day if not working at a fixed stall. All ice-cream makers will receive suitable training and must pass a health and safety test to ensure they can safely handle liquid nitrogen and that they understand the risks of using liquid nitrogen on a daily basis. Perks include free entry to large festivals, free ice-cream and the opportunity to have fun at work.

 - Marketing and PR staff

 - Product Designers

 - Transport team – responsible for transporting stalls and equipment to events and setting them up, following high safety standards

 - Finance team

 - Legal team

  \subsection{Facilities}

  We already own a small office in central London from which we operate.
  Will need large office as number of staff increases.

  Currently store equipment in a storage warehouse when not in use.
  Will need new storage locations around the country to make access to equipment easier.
